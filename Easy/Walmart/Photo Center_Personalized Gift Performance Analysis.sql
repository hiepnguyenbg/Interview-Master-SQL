-- Question 3: What is the overall average number of personalized photo gifts purchased per customer during April 2024? 
-- That is, for each customer, calculate the total number of personalized photo gifts they purchased in April 2024 â€” 
-- then return the average of those values across all customers.

SELECT SUM(quantity) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS avg_purchase
FROM fct_photo_gift_sales

--     WHERE purchase_date BETWEEN '2024-04-01' AND '2024-04-30'
